# Hand-Drawn Images Recognition

We are seeking for a way to let users draw an idea and then be able to generate an initial input from such drawing. To reach this purpose, we'll use a public google drawn images dataset to identify the variables to be taken into account to embed a drawing into a processable latent vector that can be later used to feed a more complex model.
