# Jobs Analysis

As a part of the core of Uidealist, performing an analysis over real jobs postings can be useful as a factor to determine the impact of the number of postings, distribution of salaries, industry areas, skills and specialities, all over the environment of an emergent idea within a certain knowledge area. 

We'll use different public jobs and salaries datasets to analyze by means of both descriptive and inferential statistics all the relevant variables that can interfere in a person's salary expectations. We can consider that a salary can represent the interest of a person on a company, so what if we can determine how attractive is a business to a latent collaborator?

The datasets to be analyzed come from different sources, here is a list of the current / tentative sources to be used:

- LinkedIn Job Postings (2023 - 2024): A dataset containing a list of posted jobs on LinkedIn, actually there is a code by ArshKA (https://github.com/ArshKA/LinkedIn-Job-Scraper) that retrieves data automatically (data volume depending on the number of available login accounts). The dataset to be used comes from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshkon/linkedin-job-postings) and it includes data from companies, jobs, salaries (when included in post) and more useful data.
